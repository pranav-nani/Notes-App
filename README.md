Users can easily create, edit, and delete notes, categorize them with tags or labels, and search for specific notes using a powerful search feature. The app's responsive design ensures a consistent experience across devices, allowing users to access their notes on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. With the Notes App, staying organized and capturing important information has never been easier. We also have a search bar in which we can search the notes according to their tittles. [Live Demo]().
